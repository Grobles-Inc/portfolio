# Development Workflow

## Available Scripts
From [package.json](mdc:package.json):
- `bun dev` - Start development server

- `bun preview` - Preview production build
- `bun astro` - Run Astro CLI commands

## Development Server
- Runs on default Astro port (usually 4321)
- Hot reload enabled for all file types
- TypeScript checking included

## Build Process
- Astro handles static site generation
- Optimized images through Sharp
- Sitemap generation included
- RSS feed available at `/rss.xml`

## Key Integrations
- **MDX**: For enhanced markdown with components
- **Sitemap**: Auto-generated for SEO
- **RSS**: Blog feed generation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Via Vite plugin integration

## File-based Routing
- Pages in `src/pages/` become routes
- Dynamic routes: `[...slug].astro` for blog posts
- Index files create directory routes

## Asset Optimization
- Use `astro:assets` Image component for optimization
- Sharp handles image processing
- Assets in `src/assets/` are processed
- Public assets in `public/` are served as-is
